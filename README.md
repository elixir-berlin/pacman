# Pacman

It's a fork of the original Elixir Meetup project:
https://github.com/elixir-conspiracy/pacman.


At this stage it's just a multi-player grid
of squares and moving colors!

# And its Plug
https://github.com/zampino/pac_plug

streaming grid positions through EventSource
is deployed on Heroku [here](http://enigmatic-cove-7218.herokuapp.com)!



### Note
> "the power of float!"

If you visit the app above, you have to shrink
your browser window until you get a square!
